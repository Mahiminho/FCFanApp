<h1 align="center">Real Madrid CF fan application</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>This application is my first program written using the Qt graphics library in May 2022. 
This work is my course project in the discipline of object-oriented programming. 
It doesn't have any special features and the team data was up to date as of the 2021/2022 season, but you can still play around with it.</p>
